               "We must ensure that we do not miss this chance to build a new Bangladesh due to our differences. If we lose this opportunity now, we will be defeated as a nation. To the martyrs, the injured and the living students, we pledge that we will not let this achievement go to waste. Our goal is unified: a liberal, democratic, non-discriminatory and non-sectarian Bangladesh. Local government institutions will be strengthened to consolidate democracy and ensure the decentralization of power. We have initiated steps to ensure good governance in the banking sector, which has become an industry rife with looting and corruption. Skilled professionals are being recruited, and efforts are underway to restore order in the banking sector, create a conducive business environment and control the prices of daily necessities to ease the lives of the people."
